# Arch Guesser

A casual architecture guessing game. Study a building's drawings and photographs on a drafting board, open
the hints if you want them, then guess the building, its architect, its country and its era. No scores, no timers.

170 buildings, from the Parthenon to the Elbphilharmonie, with a deep Portuguese and Brazilian selection.

## Run locally

```
./gradlew bootRun            # Spring Boot API on :8080
cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev   # Vite on :5173, proxies /api to :8080
```

Checks: `./gradlew test`, and in `frontend/`: `npx vitest run`, `npm run lint`, `npm run build`.

## Deploy (Vercel)

The deployed site is fully static; there is no Java server in production. `vercel.json` runs
`npm run build:static`, which turns `src/main/resources/data/buildings.json` into static JSON files
(`frontend/scripts/build-static-api.mjs`) and builds the app so the browser picks the random building itself.

1. Push to GitHub, then import the repository at vercel.com/new. Leave the framework preset alone; `vercel.json`
   sets the install and build commands and the output directory.
2. Every push to `main` redeploys.

Before shipping a data change, run `./gradlew test`: the Java `BuildingValidator` is what checks the catalogue
(unique ids, an exterior and an interior photo on every building, valid Wikimedia URLs, crops in range).
